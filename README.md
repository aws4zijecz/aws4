# AWS4

**Hello,**

Just to clarify: The name `aws4` was chosen as an arbitrary placeholder to name different resources, avoiding any mention of the company or `test`. It bears no meaning beyond this purpose.

## 0. Environment Preparation

To prepare the environment, I performed the following steps manually:
1. Registered a fresh GitHub account.
2. Created a new Git repository.
3. Installed AWS CLI and Terraform.
4. Registered a fresh AWS account.
5. Created an AWS user and group.
6. Attached the group to the user.
7. Generated an access key.
8. Configured AWS CLI.
9. Using `policy1.json`, created a policy named `policy1` in the AWS Console.
10. Attached the policy to the group.
11. Initialized Terraform with the AWS provider.
